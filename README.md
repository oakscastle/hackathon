# An Oaks Hackathon

[The Oaks Castle](http://oakscastle.org) is a 14,000Â²' mansion in Johnson City, TN. [Create Appalachia](http://createappalachia.org) is trying to purchase it for a public artspace.

This is a mockup of an interface for dynamically scheduling a hackathon.

It is an experiment in community space by mixing types of locations.

* Lockers are private space that is owned and may be bought and sold.
* Workspaces are individually controlled spaces.
* Games are group controlled spaces.
* Anywhere otherwise undesignated is public space.

Features of the event:

* Development is active 24 hours a day
* Cameras are widely deployed and the internet at large is encouraged to participate in meetings

Development is coordinated through regular meetings and demos.

Coders are working on tasks. As they are completed, they are reviewed and changes are merged.

## Projects

* Collaborative Series: Tools to build news style series of segments. [IPFS](//ipfs.io) allows tracking of attribution by representing clips in terms of their sources.
* Tipspace: A voluntary system for requesting renumeration for digital content.
* Topical Proxies: Citizens are able to delegate their votes based on keywords associated with the bills as well as vote directly. All without elections.
* Mimis: Public data store programatically propagated. Initially wikidata into IPFS.
* F' This, I'm Out:
 * Labor: Shift scheduling software.
 * Hostel: Space reservation software.
 * Trips: System which organizes journeys paid for enroute with labor shifts.
* Realtime Census: Weighted descriptors are used to track dispositions.
